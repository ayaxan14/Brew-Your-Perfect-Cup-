# Brew-Your-Perfect-Cup-
Brew Your Perfect Cup using the coffee making form, so it can be kept a record of (it can't actually be kept a record of), and used for future purposes like asking for your usual, or just keeping preferences somewhere safe, to be accessed when needed. I started coding 2 days ago, and this is my 3 day. I'm really enjoying myself. Once I made it, I tested it on my sister, and that's when I realized a few things:
-I had some mistakes, and extra things to add, which I was glad for since it made it overall better. (that's when I saw the benefit of letting someone else use your code)
-I really enjoy coding and seeing my lines of code come together
-I enjoy being with my family. It was nice to laugh with my sister, over some pretend game that I made with coding. 

I've been learning from the freeCodeCamp Certified Developer Course, it's been really helpful in helping me learn html and what real backpain feels like. I'm almost finished on html, just finished up accessibilty, and then a few projects linked with making websites accessible to everyone, then I'm onto CSS, which I'm so excited for. Anyways hope you like the project.
It's the end of the day, 30 mins past 12, I have been working on this project all day, and enjoying it alot. I think I'll leave it like this now, but later when I learn CSS, I'll try make an updated version of this.
